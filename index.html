                        <p>
                            Iâ€˜m glad to see you on my business card website and would like to introduce myself a little bit.
                            I'm a 23 years old .Net full stack developer from Minsk, Belarus.
                            I have more than 2 years of experience as a developer on different projects.
                            I had started my carrier by working on projects connected with neural networks but have been working
                            only with .Net stack in a huge outsourcing company for the last 2 years. Currently I'm open for any new offers.
                            I'm interested in  product oriented companies but I can also consider the offers from outsourcing companies.
                            Most of the time being a .Net developer I worked only with .Net Framework but now I'm focused on .Net Core
                            and would be very glad if you could offer me any projects with this stack.
                            If you are looking for a new developer I would be very happy to join your team and
                            to cooperate with you in the long term.
